For this assignment you'll ask for a password, ask how many students are there, then ask for each students name and then output the results to the screen. You will be using while loop and for loops in this assignment. Work on one step at a time!

Use a prompt to ask for a password (of your choice), repeat the ask for the password until the user gets it right.
When the user gets the password correct ask them how many students are in the class with a prompt.
Repeat the prompt "enter student's name" as many times as they entered students above. (ex. if 5 was entered, ask for student names 5 times.) 
Output the list of student names to the screen.

var newLi = document.createElement("li");
newLi.textContent = name;
